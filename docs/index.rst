**Before building Knitter, there is only one thing in our minds:
Gain a better vision of life, SHARE EVERYTHING !**

Knitter is a social media website where members of this site can share their ideas via «knots». The word «knot» is coming from the idea  of knitting so every knot in your profile completes the your whole knit which is you. Besides that users can sell their items, create events, join groups, create polls, message to other users, add their favorite books and quotes with Knitter. Briefly, Knitter is the junction of much used social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and Goodreads.
